### Come in, I'll put the kettle on

Welcome to this tiny corner of the internet that I'm calling home. My name is Chelsea. It's lovely to have you stop by. 

### Who I am (bitesize version)

A lover of all things technical, I spend my day as a Data Scientist building machine learning models that; in a nutshell, predict the future. Pretty neat. By evening I champion and promote women in STEM subjects through speaking at events and creating content on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. I aim to ignite a belief in young people that they have what it takes to thrive in a world of numbers and computing; regardless of gender or race. I also acknowledge that not everyone is dealt the same privileges in life and so I create free visually appealing mathematical learning materials using my background in both fine art and mathematics. And I do all of this with copious amounts of Yorkshire tea and intermittent holidays that revolve around longboarding, kitesurfing and general "vanlife" antics.
